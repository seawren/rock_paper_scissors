So this project took me a couple of weeks, and I'm pretty sure the coding will be a horrifiying mess to anyone who uses Javascript on a regular basis. But! It works and
it mostly works exactly as I wanted it to. I could have made the console.log output just a score and outcome, but I wanted to keep the dialogue I'd created involved. If
I eventually move this to a webpage, I think I can make use of the dialogue, but we'll see. There was an odd "you might want to change the return value to something 
more useful" note in the instructions that I didn't really understand. Overall I'm pretty happy with this project - it didn't take so long I got bored of it and it 
works. I have to say, though, that Javascript thinking really isn't my strength. It trips me up and I know there must be cleaner, neater ways to do things but I just 
can't think of them. It's really like nothing I've tried to learn before.
